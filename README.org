#+TITLE: Informatica @ SEFA 2018/2019

This is the  source code for the webpage of  the course of Informatica
(year 2018/2019) for the  students of SEFA at the [[http://www.dss.uniroma1.it][Department  of Statistical
Sciences]] , currently published at

http://www.massimolauria.net/courses/infosefa2018/

The idea  is that the site  is a bunch of  =org-mode= files, converted
into  a proper  webpage with  some  =org-publish= magic.  The site  is
uploaded using =rsync=.
